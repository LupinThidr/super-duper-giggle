I used to play, the beat was in my soul,
Had my files, my tracks, all under control,
I ruled the charts, the leaderboard was mine,
But then the day came, and I lost my life online.

I heard the whispers, through naominet.jp,
A new update was coming, that was all I could see.
I never thought, I'd be facing my demise,
But the Chinese Drama Incident opened my eyes.


Now I'm one of the fallen, in a sea of despair,
The SDHD corrupted everything I held dear.
Gone are the rhythms, the beats, and the sound,
I lost it all when the crash came down.
I used to be a king, now I'm broken inside,
Oh, ChusanApp.exe, I can't hide.
I used to rule, I was on top of it all,
But now all my files, are gone like a fall.


I had my Segatools, always on standby,
Fixing the glitches, while the others passed by.
But that day, Fufubot came, a bug so strong,
And it flooded the system, erasing it all along.

I tried to recover, but the sdhd-dist hit,
A flood of corrupted data, my hard drive wouldn't quit.
The Chinese Drama made the system crash,
All my precious files turned to digital ash.


Now I'm one of the fallen, in a sea of despair,
The SDHD corrupted everything I held dear.
Gone are the rhythms, the beats, and the sound,
I lost it all when the crash came down.
I used to be a king, now I'm broken inside,
Oh, ChusanApp.exe, I can't hide.
I used to rule, I was on top of it all,
But now all my files, are gone like a fall.


Oh, the data's gone, I can't bring it back,
Not even with Segatools or a rollback attack.
The Chinese Drama Incident took it all away,
Now I'm left with nothing, just empty space.


Now I'm one of the fallen, in a sea of despair,
The SDHD corrupted everything I held dear.
Gone are the rhythms, the beats, and the sound,
I lost it all when the crash came down.
I used to be a king, now I'm broken inside,
Oh, ChusanApp.exe, I can't hide.
I used to rule, I was on top of it all,
But now all my files, are gone like a fall.


We were the rhythm kings, with files so pure,
But now we’re all lost, like a digital blur.
In the wake of the crash, we stand in defeat,
The Chinese Drama Incident—it’s our final beat.


We were the rhythm kings, now we’re... just lost files,
The SDHD took it all, and now we’re out of style.
